# Mini Projects

This repository contains Deep Learning projects as well some jupyter notebooks containing DL and ML techniques for future reference.

## PyTorch Warm-up:
A list of tensor related PyTorch operations and an implementation of a two-layer neural network for my reference. The implementation of the network is based on the pytorch exmaples [repository](https://github.com/jcjohnson/pytorch-examples) by Justin Johnson. Check that repository out for more examples.

## Fashion MNIST Classification
Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article imagesâ€”consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes.
