# Mini Projects

This repository contains Deep Learning projects as well some jupyter notebooks containing DL and ML techniques for future reference.

## PyTorch Warm-up:
A list of tensor related PyTorch operations and an implementation of a two-layer neural network for my reference. The implementation of the network is based on the pytorch exmaples [repository](https://github.com/jcjohnson/pytorch-examples) by Justin Johnson. Check that repository out for more examples.
